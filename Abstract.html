    I never quite know how to start writing. The process is quite daunting: every word departs my thoughts carrying baggages of self-censorship and doubt. 
            But I like to share, even when I am not sure whether my thoughts may be special. Not so much as to platform myself on something that might garner visibility like a YouTube video, but enough to attempt blogging, which feels more comfortable.
            I have had a thought for a while that blogs seem to invite more honesty from me, and at my best writing form, I am really just unabashedly me - with lots of grammar and punctuation revisions, and not quite as much stammering or overuse of the word "like". 
            So, I hope you enjoy :)
